#NewsWise - A news aggregation platform
#Introduction NewsWise is an innovative news aggregation platform designed to procure news items from
a wide range of English-language sources, distill the core content, and assess its "positivity". 
The platform is secure, and user-friendly, and gives users the ability to see news items rated according 
to a configurable "positivity" metric. With NewsWise, users can personalize these metrics to align with
their preferences, ensuring a tailored news-reading experience

#Features
Sentiment Analysis on Comments: Our platform prioritizes a respectful and positive discussion environment.
Our sentiment analysis feature automatically scans comments to prevent the use of bad words, and
discriminatory language, ensuring a healthy and constructive conversation space for all users

Multiple Login Options: To streamline the user experience, NewsWise offers login methods
including Google and Facebook. This feature allows for a quick and hassle-free sign-in process, 
giving users immediate access to their personalized news feed

Email Notifications: Engagement doesn't end when you leave the platform. If a user hasn't logged in for 
10 days, NewsWis sends a friendly email reminder, bringing them back to the application with updates on 
what they've missed.

#User Engagement Strategy
Activation Phase First impressions matter. Users can engage with content immediately upon arrival at NewsWise 
no registration is required. However, interactive features like liking, sharing, saving, and commenting on news 
items are made accessible with an easy pop-up registration -- choose from quick social media sign-in options or 
a more traditional email registration.
Retention Phase The retention strategy includes email notifications. These are triggered after a 30-day inactivity 
period, re-engaging users with content that piques their interest and draws them back into the NewsWise community.
